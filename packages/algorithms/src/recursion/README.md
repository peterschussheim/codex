# recursion helpers

[Reggie Braithwaite](http://raganwald.com/2016/12/27/recursive-data-structures.html) wrote an interesting article that provides interesting tools that can help when designing and implementing recursive algorithms.

The idea is to:

> organize an algorithm so that it resembles the data structure it manipulates, and organize a data structure so that it resembles the algorithms that manipulate it.

Included in this directory are examples for linear, binary and multi recursive algortithms.
